# Learning_Management_System

This is a Java project using MVC architecture.
In this project, we have 3 parts such as admin, teacher, and student. Admin will add the course for the academic year and
teacher will add the notes for that particular course and assign the assignments for the courses. Students can view all the notes related to courses and 
do submit the assignments given by the teacher.
The database is using MySQL workbench.
